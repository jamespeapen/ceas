\title{Read Seahorse Wave Excel File}
\usage{
read_data(
  rep_list,
  norm = NULL,
  sheet = 2,
  delimiter = " ",
  norm_column = "exp_group",
  norm_method = "minimum"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{rep_list}{A list of Seahorse Wave excel export files. One file per
replicate. If your data is in a directory called "seahorse_data", use
\code{list.files("seahorse_data", pattern = "*.xlsx", full.names = TRUE)} to make
a list of the excel files. Add multiple replicates with care - see details.}

\item{norm}{A csv file with the experimental groups and their normalization
values. Leave unset if normalization is not required. See \code{\link[=normalize]{normalize()}}.}

\item{sheet}{The number of the excel sheet containing the long-form Seahorse
data. Default is 2 because the long-form output from Seahorse Wave is on
sheet 2}

\item{delimiter}{The delimiter between the group name and the assay type in
the Group column of the wave output. e.g. "Group1 MITO" would use a space
character as delimiter.}

\item{norm_column}{Whether to normalize by \code{"Well"} or \code{"exp_group"} column.
The first column of the normalization csv provided should match this value.}

\item{norm_method}{How to normalize each well or experimental group (specified by \code{norm_column}):
\itemize{
\item by its corresponding row in the \code{norm} csv (\code{"self"}) or
\item by the minimum of the \code{measure} column in the provided \code{norm} csv (\code{"minimum"}).
}

See the \code{normalize()} function for more details.}

\description{
Reads input seahore data from an excel Seahorse Wave File. It  assumes your
data is background normalized.
}
\details{
Although ceas enables integration of multiple biological and/or technical
replicates, previous work has reported high inter-plate variation (Yepez et.
al 2018). If you don't want your replicate data combined, you can either:
\itemize{
\item make sure that the names of the common groups between the replicates are
different.
\item in downstream analyses (\code{get_energetics_summary}, \code{bioscope_plot},
\code{rate_plot}, \code{atp_plot}), use \code{sep_reps = TRUE} to do all calculations and
plotting separately for each replicate.
}

\strong{NOTE:} to maintain backwards compatibility \code{sep_reps} is currently
\code{FALSE} by default, but will be set to \code{TRUE} in a future release.

\examples{
rep_list <- system.file("extdata", package = "ceas") |>
  list.files(pattern = "*.xlsx", full.names = TRUE)
seahorse_rates <- read_data(rep_list, sheet = 2)
head(seahorse_rates, n = 10)

# normalization by well using raw cell count or protein quantity
norm_csv <- system.file("extdata", package = "ceas") |>
  list.files(pattern = "well_norm.csv", full.names = TRUE)
seahorse_rates.norm <- read_data(
  rep_list,
  norm = norm_csv,
  norm_column = "well",
  norm_method = "self",
  sheet = 2
)
head(seahorse_rates.norm, n = 10)

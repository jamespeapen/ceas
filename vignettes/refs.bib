abstract = {Partitioning of ATP generation between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation is central to cellular bioenergetics but cumbersome to measure. We describe here how rates of ATP generation by each pathway can be calculated from simultaneous measurements of extracellular acidification and oxygen consumption. We update theoretical maximum ATP yields by mitochondria and cells catabolizing different substrates. Mitochondrial P/O ratios (mol of ATP generated per mol of [O] consumed) are 2.73 for oxidation of pyruvate plus malate and 1.64 for oxidation of succinate. Complete oxidation of glucose by cells yields up to 33.45 ATP/glucose with a maximum P/O of 2.79. We introduce novel indices to quantify bioenergetic phenotypes. The glycolytic index reports the proportion of ATP production from glycolysis and identifies cells as primarily glycolytic (glycolytic index > 50%) or primarily oxidative. The Warburg effect is a chronic increase in glycolytic index, quantified by the Warburg index. Additional indices quantify the acute flexibility of ATP supply. The Crabtree index and Pasteur index quantify the responses of oxidative and glycolytic ATP production to alterations in glycolysis and oxidative reactions, respectively; the supply flexibility index quantifies overall flexibility of ATP supply; and the bioenergetic capacity quantifies the maximum rate of total ATP production. We illustrate the determination of these indices using C2C12 myoblasts. Measurement of ATP use revealed no significant preference for glycolytic or oxidative ATP by specific ATP consumers. Overall, we demonstrate how extracellular fluxes quantitatively reflect intracellular ATP turnover and cellular bioenergetics. We provide a simple spreadsheet to calculate glycolytic and oxidative ATP production rates from raw extracellular acidification and respiration data.}
